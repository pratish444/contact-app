# CONTACT APP

##  INTRODUCTION
A simple Android application to manage contacts. This app demonstrates the use of the Room Database for storing and managing contact information, as well as Data Binding and MVVM Architecture for clean and scalable app design.

##  Technologies Used


   - **Room Database**:
        Handles local data storage with SQLite integration.
        Provides a clean API for data persistence.
     
   - **MVVM Architecture**:
        Ensures a clear separation of business logic, UI, and data access layers.
        
   - **Data Binding**:
        Reduces boilerplate code by directly binding UI components to observable data sources.

    
  - **LiveData**:
        Observes changes in data and updates the UI reactively.
        
   - **Jetpack Components**:
        ViewModel, Lifecycle-aware components, and Room.
